  // During this period of self-exile, Beethoven composed many of his most admired works; 
   //  //  //his seventh symphony premiered in 1813, with its second movement, 

//Allegretto, achieving widespread critical acclaim.[3] 

          //He composed his Missa Solemnis for a number of years before it premiered prior to his ninth symphony in 1824,   // 



   //with the latter gaining fame for being among the first examples of a choral symphony.[4] 

                    //    In 1826, his fourteenth string quartet was noted not only for its seven linked movements played without a break and 

 //is considered the final major piece performed before his death a year later.
